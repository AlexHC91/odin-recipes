        These grilled pineapple lime chicken thighs are tender, juicy, and
        flavorful. They marinate briefly in seasoned lime and pineapple juices,
        and are scattered with pineapple chunks after grilling.

      Steps
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine pineapple juice, zest and juice of 1 lime, olive oil, adobo
          seasoning, salt, and cayenne, in a large resealable plastic bag.
          Gently squeeze the bag to mix marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chicken thighs to marinade, and gently squeeze contents to coat
          chicken. Move thighs inside the bag into a single layer. Gently press
          out the air, reseal, and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 2 hours,
          turning every 20 minutes or so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Clean and
          oil the grates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place chicken on the oiled grate and drizzle with marinade. Grill 2 to
          3 minutes, give each piece a quarter turn, and grill 2 or 3 minutes
          more. Turn chicken over and repeat. Grill until chicken is no longer
          pink at the center and juices run clear. An instant read thermometer
          inserted near the center should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove chicken to a plate, cover with foil, and rest for 8 to 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut remaining lime in half and squeeze 1 lime half over chicken. Cut
          the other lime half into slices. Sprinkle pineapple pieces over the
          chicken; garnish with lime slices and cilantro sprigs.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
