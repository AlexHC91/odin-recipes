# odin-recipes

In this project I created a plain but fully functional HTML recipe site. I learned how to structure basic HTML pages, link between them, and leverage unordered and ordered lists for content organization. I also gained experience using Git and GitHubâ€”setting up a repo, committing after each meaningful change, and publishing my work. This project lays a solid groundwork for future CSS and JavaScript enhancements, and it also builds a small, live website I can share.
